To install this Application and visualize in a browser window run 

    $ npm i

if you don't have npm installed search for it and install it.

It's common that it goes with nodejs.

To run this stuff use 

    $ npm run start


It would be great if there will be a clearer structure in the package and installation-process, since it's close to common that you get warinings and errors.

Thanks to all hackers getting things useable! Especially npm/opensourcing and all their unknown invested time.
